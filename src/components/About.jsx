        As a tech professional with over 4+ years of experience ranging from
        having being a support application analyst to being a software
        developer. I have learned to utilize cutting-edge development and
        techniques through the use of React, Next JS, HTML, CSS/SASS,
        Javascript/Typescript. I have also cultivated an impressive skill set by
        having strong debugging skills to even photoshop and figma skills. These
        technical skills allow me to create beautiful, dynamic, and responsive
        websites while writing clean code that is reusable. I thrive in
        collaborative environments with cross-functional teams from designers to
        software engineers to managers.
